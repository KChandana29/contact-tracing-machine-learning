# contact-tracing-machine-learning
The project uses digital contact tracing algorithm that utilizes machine learning and GPS data to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of contact tracing efforts. 
Traditional manual contact tracing methods can be time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to potential gaps in identifying all potential contacts. 
By leveraging the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, this algorithm can group data points based on proximity and identify individuals who may have been in close contact with infected patients.
 The use of GPS data enables precise tracking of individuals' movements, offering valuable insights into potential contact points and patterns of transmission.
